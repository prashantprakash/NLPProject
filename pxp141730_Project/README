Number of files inside POS Folder : 6 Java Files 
Number of files indside Data Folder : 4 

How to run the Program: 

Step 1: go to POS Folder : cd POS 
Step 2: Compile all Java programs present inside this folder : javac *.java 
Step 3: Run HMMImpl class , this is the entry point of the system. 

java HMMImpl p1 p2 p3 p4


where:
p1: absolute path to train sentences file 
p2: absolute path to train tags file
p3: aboslute path to test sentences file
p4: absolute path to test tags file 

Note: all these files are present inside data folder 

train sentences file: brown-train-sentences.txt 
train tags file : brown-train-tags.txt
test sentences file:brown-test-sentences.txt
test tags file:brown-test-tags.txt

sample command : 
java HMMImpl /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-train-sentences.txt /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-train-tags.txt  /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-test-sentences.txt /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-test-tags.txt

After running this program in the end it asks for a sentence as well to decide POS tagging you can input any sentence. 

Also the output tags file gets created inside the folder /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/ by name brown-test-sentences_Viterbi_tag.txt

I have also written a scorer class which actually build the Ambiguity Matrix: 

Run scorer class: 

java Scorer p1 p2 p3 p4 

where:
p1: absolute path of test tags file
p2: absolute path of tags file generated by model
p3: absolute path of test sentences file
p4: absolute path of train tags file

Note all these files will be again found inside the data folder.

sample command : 

java Scorer /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-test-tags.txt /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-test-sentences_Viterbi_tag.txt /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-test-sentences.txt /home/004/p/px/pxp141730/data/brown-train-tags.txt

one score.html file will be cretaed in the POS folder only you can see this file in browser to understand the ambiguity.
